MyFacebook Connect is the ultimate solution for bridging between MyBB and Facebook, featuring smooth login and registration.

### Overview

MyFacebook Connect adds a lightweight and high quality interface between your MyBB forum and Facebook, enabling login and registration with this social network.

Existing users can associate their accounts to Facebook in order to use the login functionality without having to create a fresh new account. Both users and admins can also choose what informations should be imported and synced with their Facebook account every time they log in.

Many customization options are available, including an anti-spam feature to allow verified-only accounts to register and an option to post a customizable message on the user's wall when he registers or associates his account to Facebook.

### Documentation

The official documentation can be found [here](http://github.com/Shade-/MyFacebook-Connect/wiki).

### Pricing

MyFacebook Connect is free as in freedom. However, since I am a Medicine and Surgery student and I have to pay avg 2.2k euros per year to study in the local university I am attending, **donations via PayPal** are much appreciated! I havenâ€™t received a single donation for this plugin so far. [Be the first](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=89NU4PS5BZZQE)!
